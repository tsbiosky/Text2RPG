His calm and dignified expression is framed by long earlobes. When prepared for battle, he wears a functional suit of lamellar armor made of leather and iron scales over his robes and carries his signature twin swords, the Shuang Gu Jian."

He wears a commoner's tunic, perhaps sleeveless or with the sleeves rolled up, revealing muscular arms. His clothes are practical and coarse, suited for his work as a butcher and wine-seller. In battle, he wields a massive eighteen-foot-long serpent spear.",

  "location": "Anxi County, a small administrative center in late Eastern Han Dynasty China. The architecture consists of traditional timber-frame buildings with grey-tiled, overhanging roofs. The central location is the county office (Yamen), a modest complex with a main hall for hearings and a public courtyard in front, where a sturdy wooden hitching post stands. Nearby is the official posthouse (驿馆), a slightly more refined lodging for traveling bureaucrats. The overall color palette is one of earthy browns, dusty greys, and the faded greens of the surrounding plains and willow trees. The culture is one of simmering discontent, where impoverished commoners respect benevolent leaders but are oppressed by a corrupt and arrogant imperial bureaucracy that demands bribes and respect."
